                <p>Here we are at the beginning of a New Year! 2022 is here with all the promise and potential that
                    every New Year provides us. Of course, as with every New Year, there are many things that are beyond
                    our control. But it is important to focus on what we can control. Among them are our attitudes, our
                    conduct, our words, and our goals. </p>
